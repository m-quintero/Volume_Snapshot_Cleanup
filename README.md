# Volume_Snapshot_Cleanup
The `volume_snap_cleaner.sh` script is designed to automate the deletion of unused AWS EBS volumes or snapshots. It allows users to specify whether they are deleting an EBS volume or a snapshot, choose the AWS region, set the account type (commercial or government), and add a ticket identifier for operation tracking.
